# Election-Application

This is a very basic Web based Election Application that can be used for council elections in college.

This has 2 modules : 
1. Admin
2. Student

1. Admin Module :
The user id for admin is "1234" and password is "abcd". This can be changed. The admin can add candidate and view results.

2. Student Module :
The student is required to login using his/her credentials. The table for this is named as "students". Once a student votes for all candidates, he/she will not be able to vote again. The voted attribute change from 0 to 1.

The code is in PHP and installing WAMP or XAMPP is recommended.
